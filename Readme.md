## About:-

In this app we provide three timers to the user to select their preffered egg hardness and after selecting  respective option an timer is triggered and when it is done it updated the label and plays an alarm sound to notify the user. There is also an progress bar attached at the bottom of the options to show the progress of the timer and give an indication of the time left.
